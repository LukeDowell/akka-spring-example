# Words with Salt

This application is intended to be used as a reference for working with Scala, Akka and Spring Boot.

The requirements arose from a sailing club that I belong to, in which several of the sailors would like to improve 
their sailing vernacular and also receive updates on weather conditions around Lake Michigan.
